# Joy Wangari Portfolio
<h1> Hey There ! I'm Joy :wave: </h1>
<h2> This is my Data Science Portfolio:smile: </h2>

I am a Junior Data Scientist with a love for coding and statistics. I am determined to learn more everyday.
This is a collection of my work that will showcase my skills as I learn them.
