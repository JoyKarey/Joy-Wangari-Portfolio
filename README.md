# Joy Wangari Portfolio
<h1> Hey There ! I'm Joy :wave: </h1>
<h2> This is my Data Science Portfolio:smile: </h2>

I am a Junior Data Scientist with a love for coding and statistics. I am determined to learn more everyday.
This is a collection of my work that will showcase my skills as I learn them.
## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting King County Housing Prices](https://github.com/JoyKarey/Phase-2-Project/blob/main/Student.ipynb):Used multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
 	- [Build a Model to Predict Blood Pressure](https://github.com/JoyKarey/Joy-Wangari-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Machine_Learning_Fundamentals.ipynb):An end-to-end machine learning workflow, focusing on the fundamental concepts of machine learning theory and processes.
